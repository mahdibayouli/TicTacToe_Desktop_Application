## General info
This project is a TicTacToe desktop application. It has three game modes: easy, hard and multiplayer.
In easy mode the computer randomly chooses an empty field, whereas in hard mode the computer uses an AI implemented with the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). 
In both these single player modes, the user can either choose to play with X or with O.
There is the options to restart the game and reset the score to 0.
